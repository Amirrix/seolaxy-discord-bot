## Environment Variables Summary

After completing this setup, you should have these values for your `.env` file:

```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token_from_step_5
CLIENT_ID=your_application_id_from_step_3
GUILD_ID=your_server_id_from_step_9
```

## Verification

To verify your setup:

1. Check that your bot appears in your Discord server's member list
2. The bot should show as offline (gray status) until you start your application
3. You should see the bot has the permissions you granted

## Troubleshooting

### Bot doesn't appear in server
- Make sure you completed the invite process in Step 8
- Check that you selected the correct server
- Verify you have "Manage Server" permission

### Can't copy Application ID
- Make sure you're on the "General Information" tab
- The Application ID is also called "Client ID"

### Bot token issues
- Never share your bot token
- If compromised, regenerate it in the Bot section
- Update your `.env` file with the new token

### Permission errors
- Ensure your bot has the necessary permissions in your server
- Check channel-specific permissions
- Verify the bot role is positioned correctly in your server's role hierarchy

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit your bot token to version control**
2. **Use environment variables for sensitive data**
3. **Only grant necessary permissions**
4. **Regularly rotate your bot token if needed**
5. **Monitor your bot's activity**

## Next Steps

After completing this setup:

1. Update your `.env` file with the obtained values
2. Deploy your slash commands: `npm run deploy`
3. Start your bot: `npm start`
4. Test the `/hello` command in your Discord server
